### Technical Background
I am a question bank ❓ coupled with curiosity 🕵️‍♀️ in learning new things. As a passionate technical geek with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science 👩‍🎓, my academic journey planted the first seeds of my technical knowledge. Theoretical and practical training in C, JAVA, Python, and MS SQL, alongside subjects like Design and Analysis of Algorithms and Formal Language and Automata Theory, drove me to explore various aspects of computer science.

After joining a firm, I further expanded my knowledge in no-code and low-code applications such as PowerBI, Tableau, MS Excel, and Azure. This exploration did not stop there; I continually seek new ways to address real-world problems. The recent surge 🤯 of AI systems, like ChatGPT and Co-pilot, has motivated me to dive into machine learning and deep learning concepts. Yet, this is just another step in my unending technical quest🕴️.......
